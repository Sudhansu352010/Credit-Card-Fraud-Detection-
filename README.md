#  Details of Machine Learning Algorithm
# Logistic Regression
1. Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not.
2. It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables.
3. It is a powerful tool for decision-making.
4. For example email spam or not.

# Decision Tree Classifier
1. A decision tree is one of the most powerful tools of supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks.

2. It builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

3. The goal is to find the attribute that maximizes the information gain or the reduction in impurity after the split.

# Random Forest Classifier
1. We know that a forest comprises of numerous trees, and the more trees more it will be robust.
2. Similarly, the greater the number of trees in a Random Forest Algorithm, the higher its accuracy and problem-solving ability.
3. Random Forest is a classifier that contains several decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
4. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and improve the performance of the model.

# Summary
1.The use of machine learning techniques for credit card fraud detection is highly beneficial. 
2. This project highlights the importance of accurate and efficient fraud detection systems in itigating financial losses. 
3. Future applications and extensions of this project are worth exploring.

# CHALLENGES FACED
1. The main challenge in credit card fraud detection are:
2. Huge Size of Data : millions of transactions are processed everyday.
3. Imbalanced data set : more than 99% transactions  are  legitimate
4. Adaptive techniques :  fraudsters change style of bluff detection system
5. Availability of data :  bank  doesn’t reveal customer information.
